# yap-Applications

The goal is to have small web apps that:

- work on any device (with a browser)
- can be "installed" on mobile (link added to the home screen)
- work offline (using service workers, PWA)
- synchronize seamlessly to a tiny self-hosted server (using yjs and websockets), allowing
    - multi-device usage
    - multi-user collaboration
    - backups


Here are some applications available:

- [gh](https://github.com/twitwi/yap-bbox) [cb](https://codeberg.org/twitwi/yap-bbox) yap-BBox is a time tracker which is yjs-backed, collaborative, offline-first.
- [gh](https://github.com/twitwi/yap-chop) [cb](https://codeberg.org/twitwi/yap-chop) yap-Chop is a shopping list app which is yjs-backed, collaborative, offline-first.
- [gh](https://github.com/twitwi/yap-habits) [cb](https://codeberg.org/twitwi/yap-habits) yap-Habits is a micro-habit tracker which is yjs-backed, collaborative, offline-first.
- [gh](https://github.com/twitwi/yap-splitboard) [cb](https://codeberg.org/twitwi/yap-splitboard) yap-SplitBoard is a nested split dashboard to aggregate small applications.
